<h1>The OpendTect Installation Manager</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>OpendTect has a utility to create and manage multiple installations of the OpendTect system. It takes care of initial installation, extensions, and upgrade/update. This 'OpendTect Installation Manager' will upgrade itself when necessary.</p>
  <p>The Installation Manager can be installed in the usual way for your Operating System. After download from <a href="http://opendtect.org">opendtect.org</a> you need to execute the self-extracting installer. This can usually be done by double-clicking on the downloaded executable package.</p>

  <p>Once OpendTect is installed it is possible to start the Installation Manager from within the OpendTect main window. That is, if your system administration allow it. And actual application management can of course only be done if you have the right permissions.</p>

<a name="LINK-UTILITIES.INSTALLATION.MANAGER"></a><h2 class="western">Starting Window</h2>
<p>
The starting window of the installation manager allows you to setup some basic parameters before the actual package/plugin selection starts.
</p><p><a name="LINK-UTILITIES.INSTALLATION.MANAGER.BASEDIR"></a><a name="LINK-UTILITIES.INSTALLATION.MANAGER.PACKAGESEL"></a><a name="LINK-UTILITIES.INSTALLATION.DOWNLOADFAILED"></a><a name="LINK-UTILITIES.INSTALLATION.MANAGER.PACKAGE"></a>

</p><p>
The field for <i>Release Type</i> usually selects between 'Stable' and 'Development' releases.  The <i>installation base directory</i> is the directory where the OpendTect versions will reside. It can contain multiple releases and release types, and will also contain the latest installation manager executables.
</p><p>
This directory will be remembered. If you initially select an exisiting non-empty directory, then you get this warning message:
</p><p>

</p><p>
If you want to install into a sub-directory of the selected path, then the
second option must be selected. It will create a sub-directory
  &quot;OpendTect&quot; at where the installation itself will reside.<br />
</p><p>After this, if this is a first time, you can select typical package setups.

  <br /><br />

<h2>Package Manager</h2>
  <p>After this, you will be in the OpendTect Package Manager. This is the main window in which allows you to manage the OpendTect installation. There are two ways of viewing:<br /><br /><img src="pics/fig-UTILITIES_005.png" name="graphics5" align="bottom" width="860" height="531" border="0" alt="fig-UTILITIES_005" /><br /><i>Classic View</i><br /><br /><img src="pics/fig-PKGMGR_HTML.png" name="graphics6" align="bottom" width="600" height="585" border="0" alt="fig-PKGMGR_HTML" /><br /><i>HTML
View</i>
</p><p>
In both views you can select multiple items to be installed. The installation manager will display the previously installed version for this installation and will show it in the <i>Installed version</i> field.
</p><p>To read more about a
particular item in the list, select the item by clicking on it and
read the description on to the right panel.
</p>
<a name="Utilities_menu"></a><h3 class="western">Utilities menu</h3>
<p>On the top left corner of the package selection window there is a
&quot;Utilities&quot; menu, which offers some useful functionalities
  for the installation manager.<br /><img src="pics/utilitiesmenu.png" name="graphics9" align="bottom" width="353" height="174" border="0" alt="utilitiesmenu.png" /><br /><br />The
  utilities menu has the following options.<br /><br />1) Export download
  list<br />2) Offline installation<br />3) Rollback<br />4) Show log
  file.<br /><br />Each of these options are explained below in details.</p>
<a name="Export_download_list"></a><h5 class="western">Export download list</h5>
<p>This option allows the user to download the list of URLs of the
individual packages from the download site. This list is stored in a
text file which can be used later to download these files directly
without the help of the installer program. After downloading, user
can run his/her own unzipping scripts to install the packages
manually. This facility was only developed for the Linux users.
Windows users can use this feature, provided they can prepare their
own installation scripts for the installation,.</p>
<a name="Offline_installation"></a><h5 class="western">Offline
installation</h5>
  <p><img src="pics/offline_dlg.png" name="graphics7" align="left" width="392" height="226" border="0" alt="offline_dlg" /><br clear="left" /><br /><br />
</p>
<p>The offline installation tool allows you to create offline
installation bundle from selected packages to any of your local
folders along with necessary installation scripts/programs. Once all
the packages and scripts/programs are downloaded to this folder, this
folder can be copied to any other work stations to install OpendTect
by running the scripts/program from this folder. The user interface
has two fields, the first one specifies the the location of the
bundle folder, and the field below sets the bundle directory name.  
</p>
  <p><br /><br />Windows:<br />On Windows you can run the od_setup.exe
  program that is present in the folder.<br /><br />Linux<br />On Linux you
have to run the unix_install.csh script.</p>
<a name="Rollback"></a><h5 class="western">Rollback</h5>
<p>Rollback tool allows you to restore your previous version of the
installation. If after updating the software you feel uncomfortable
with some of the new features and want to go back to your previous
installation, you have to use this tool. As this tool will change
your entire installation so you have to use it cautiously.</p>
<a name="showlogfile"></a><h5 class="western">Show log file</h5>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">The installation manager keeps track of
all the action it is executing in a log file. This log file can be
viewed from this tool. This is useful for debugging purposes. If you
face any trouble during the installation process you can send this
file to OpendTect support if needed.</p>
