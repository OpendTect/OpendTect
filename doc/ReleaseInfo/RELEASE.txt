Release numbering.

Current Major release: 3.1
Current Minor release: 3 -> 3.1.4
Current Patch update:  '' -> 3.1.4
Stable release has even release numbers: 3.0
Development release has odd release numbers: 3.1


1) The patch update number only shows in the dTect title bar,
   not in the filenames of the packages.
2) Change of:
   * Major number: possible interface change -> plugins may need change
   * Minor number: possible interface extension -> plugins may need a re-build
   * Patch update: implementation change -> plugins need no update.
   Note: because this is a development release, we sometimes have a couple of
   minor interface changes in the patch releases; we hope for the best.
