<h1>OpendTect tutorial plugin - credits</h1>

<a name=intro><h2>Introduction</h2></a>
<p>When we started OpendTect, we just thought about getting it up and running - quickly. After a while we found out that plugin builders needed some code that showed the basic functionality for basic stuff like Seismics, Wells, Horizons.</p>
Thus, the Tutorial plugin project was born. The initial code was made by Raman and Bert, when Raman visited Enschede in 2007. He took the project back to India where he subsequently maintains the high standards he set for this beautiful plugin. <small>Bert made this text BTW.</small>

<p>Usually, you list all links in this top-level document, but to be honest for this Tutorial plugin we don't really have any credits - OK maybe <a href="http://dgbes.com">dGB</a>, but that's sort of default. Still, let's just link to the <a href="SeisTools.html">SeisTools</a> page.
