<h1>History</h1>
</center>
<p>
OpendTect is not a processing package. But when developing it into a more complete system, we found more and more the need to be able to offer some processing functionality to our users. As processing is not our real area of expertese, we figured it would be better to just link to an existing free processing package.
</p>
Familiar with <a href="http://www.cwp.mines.edu/cwpcodes">Seismic UNIX</a> (SU), we found a new promising package including most of SU's functionality, with an active community and fresh new ideas. Furthermore, Madagascar seemed to be easier to link to because of the availability program descriptions in text format.

After communicating with potential sponsors, and some posts to the user's mailing list, we decided to go for Madagascar.
