<h1>Credits - the GapDecon plugin</h1>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>
This plugin was created for <a href="http://www.addaxpetroleum.com">Addax Petroleum</a>. The initiator was Bernd Fiebig, who frequently needed post-stack multiple removal capabilities for his work. Being a user of OpendTect already, he found funds to get GapDecon functionality incorporated in OpendTect.
</p>
The type of multiple removal algorithm chosen for this application was the well known least squares prediction error filter, a.k.a "Gap Decon". This filter aims to flatten a user defined part of an auto-correlation function.
</p>
<h2>Implementation</h2>
<p>
Gap Decon was implemented by H&eacute;l&egrave;ne Payraudeau (now: H&eacute;l&egrave;ne Huck).
