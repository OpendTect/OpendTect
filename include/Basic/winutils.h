				CSIDL
     _________________________________________________________________

   CSIDL values provide a unique system-independent way to identify
   special folders used frequently by applications, but which may not
   have the same name or location on any given system. For example, the
   system folder may be "C:\Windows" on one system and "C:\Winnt" on
   another.

          Documents. This should be distinguished from the virtual My
          Documents folder in the namespace. To access that virtual

          data under the locations referred to by CSIDL_APPDATA or
          CSIDL_LOCAL_APPDATA.

   CSIDL_PROFILES (0x003e)
          Version 6.0. The file system directory containing user profile
          folders. A typical path is C:\Documents and Settings.

   CSIDL_PROGRAM_FILES (0x0026)
          Version 5.0. The Program Files folder. A typical path is
          C:\Program Files.

   CSIDL_PROGRAM_FILES_COMMON (0x002b)
          Version 5.0. A folder for components that are shared across
          applications. A typical path is C:\Program Files\Common. Valid
          only for Windows NT, Windows 2000, and Windows XP systems. Not
          valid for Windows Millennium Edition (Windows Me).

   CSIDL_PROGRAMS (0x0002)
          The file system directory that contains the user's program
          groups (which are themselves file system directories). A
          typical path is C:\Documents and Settings\username\Start
          Menu\Programs.

   CSIDL_RECENT (0x0008)
          The file system directory that contains shortcuts to the user's
          most recently used documents. A typical path is C:\Documents
          and Settings\username\My Recent Documents. To create a shortcut
          in this folder, use SHAddToRecentDocs. In addition to creating
          the shortcut, this function updates the Shell's list of recent
          documents and adds the shortcut to the My Recent Documents
          submenu of the Start menu.

   CSIDL_SENDTO (0x0009)
          The file system directory that contains Send To menu items. A
          typical path is C:\Documents and Settings\username\SendTo.

   CSIDL_STARTMENU (0x000b)
          The file system directory containing Start menu items. A
          typical path is C:\Documents and Settings\username\Start Menu.

   CSIDL_STARTUP (0x0007)
          The file system directory that corresponds to the user's
          Startup program group. The system starts these programs
          whenever any user logs onto Windows NT or starts Windows 95. A
          typical path is C:\Documents and Settings\username\Start
          Menu\Programs\Startup.

   CSIDL_SYSTEM (0x0025)
          Version 5.0. The Windows System folder. A typical path is
          C:\Windows\System32.

   CSIDL_TEMPLATES (0x0015)
          The file system directory that serves as a common repository
          for document templates. A typical path is C:\Documents and
          Settings\username\Templates.

   CSIDL_WINDOWS (0x0024)
          Version 5.0. The Windows directory or SYSROOT. This corresponds
          to the %windir% or %SYSTEMROOT% environment variables. A
          typical path is C:\Windows.

   Remarks

     These values supersede the use of environment variables for this
     purpose.

     A CSIDL is used in conjunction with one of four Shell functions,
     SHGetFolderLocation, SHGetFolderPath, SHGetSpecialFolderLocation,
     and SHGetSpecialFolderPath, to retrieve a special folder's path or
     pointer to an item identifier list (PIDL).

     Combine CSIDL_FLAG_CREATE with any of the other CSIDLs to force the
     creation of the associated folder. The remaining CSIDLs correspond
     to either file system folders or virtual folders. Where the CSIDL
     identifies a file system folder, a commonly used path is given as
     an example. Other paths may be used. Some CSIDLs can be mapped to
     an equivalent %VariableName% environment variable. CSIDLs are more
     reliable, however, and should be used if possible.
