\defgroup Well Well
\brief All %Well related classes

  The OpendTect Well object is a single track, logs and markers bearing thing
  with some global data and possibly a Depth vs %Time model attached.
  Therefore, it is not a POSC well in the sense that it describes the
  data for one well bore only. This may mean duplication when more well
  tracks share an upper part.

  The well track is a 3D line-segment geometry. The traditional description of
  the Z value in true vertical depth (TVD) breaks down miserably when
  horizontal well tracks (and worse) come into play. A much better single
  coordinate to describe the position in a well is the depth-along-hole (or
  more correctly distance-along-hole). This is why everything in this module
  is related to the DAH, not TVD. There are facilities to work with TVD, though.

  Further it seems to me that anyone familiar with wells, logs and that kind of
  concepts should find this module's object model fairly intuitive.
