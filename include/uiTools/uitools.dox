\defgroup uiTools uiTools
\brief User Interface Tools

  The uiTools module is a collection of tools that are based on the uiBase
  module (and thus on Qt services) but that combine uiBase services without
  accessing Qt at all. Throughout OpendTect, Qt is not directly accessed from
  anywhere else other than uiBase, not from uiTools either.

  Some commonly used classes:
  <ul>
  <li>uiGenInput is the most common user interface element we use. It represents
  a generalized input field for strings, numbers, bools, positions and more. The  idea is to tell the class the characteristics of the data you need to input.
  uiGenInput will then select the best user interface element for that type of
  data.
  <li>uiTaskRunner executes the work encapsulated in any Task object, like
  Executor's. An Executor object holds an amount of work that is probably too
  big to be finished instantly, hence the user must be able to see the progress
  and must be able to stop it.
  <li>uiFileBrowser shows the contents of text files. If editable, the user can
  edit the text and save it.
  </ul>
