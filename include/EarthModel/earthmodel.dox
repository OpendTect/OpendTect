\defgroup EarthModel EarthModel
\brief Module with classes related to horizons, faults and bodies

  Objects like horizons, faults and bodies are all earth model objects.
  Such objects can be described in various ways, and the EM way is the
  way we have chosen for OpendTect.

  A big part of this module deals with surfaces of some kind. Horizons, faults,
  and sets of (fault-)sticks each have their own peculiarities.

  Most interesting classes:

  - EM::EMObject, base class for the EarthModel objects
  - EM::EMManager, responsible for the loading and deleting of the objects

  Earth models have the nasty habit of changing over time. Therefore, edit
  history matters are handled by the Undo objects.
