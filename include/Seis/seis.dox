\defgroup Seis Seis
\brief This module contains classes related to handling of Seismic data

Seismic data is sampled data along a vertical axis. Many 'traces' will usually
occupy a volume (3D seismics) or separate lines (2D data).

There's always lots of data, so it has to be stored efficiently. A consequence
is that storage on disk versus usage in memory are - contrary to most other data
types - closely linked. Instead of just loading the data in one go, we always
need to prepare a subcube of data before the work starts.

Although this model may have its flaws and may be outdated in the light of ever
increasing computer memory, it will probably satisfy our needs for some time
at the start of the 21st century.

The SeisTrc class is designed to be able to even have 1, 2 or 4-byte data in
the data() - the access functions get() and %set() will know how to unpack and
pack this from/to float. SeisTrc objects can also hold more than one component.

To keep the SeisTrc object small, a lot of operations and processing options
have been moved to specialised objects - see seistrcprop.h and
seissingtrcproc.h .
