\brief User Interface related to I/O

  This module contains some basic classes that handle the selection and
  management of an IOObj. An IOObj contains all info necessary to be able
  to load or store an object from disk. In OpendTect, users select IOObj's,
  not files (at least most often not direct but via na IOObj entry). Users
  recognise the IOObj by its name. Every IOObj has a unique identifier, the
  IOObj's key() which is a MultiID.

  In order to make the right selection, the IOObj selectors must know the
  context of the selection: what type of object, is it for read or write,
  should the user be able to create a new entry, and so forth. That's why
  you have to pass a CtxtIOObj in many cases.

  Other objects have been stuffed into this module as there was space left.
  More seriously, one can say that those objects are too OpendTect specific for
  the uiTools directory, but too general for any specific UI directory.
