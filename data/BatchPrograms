cbvs_browse
	Arg: M`FileRead`Cube to browse
	Comment:  Browse seismic cubes (in the default 'CBVS' format)
!
cbvs_dump
	Arg: M`FileRead`Parameter file
	Comment: Dump seismic cubes of the 'CBVS' format
	Comment: Output can be Ascii or Binary
	Comment: If 'Output.Mode' is set to 'Inquire', ranges are reported for the cube.
	ExampleInput: cbvs_dump_example.par
!
cbvs_export_xyzv
	Arg: M`FileRead`Input seismic cube
	Arg: M`FileWrite`Output X Y Z Value file
	Arg: O`QWord`Subcube specification
	Comment: Convert (part of) seismic cubes of the 'CBVS' format
	Comment: The optional subcube specification is of the form:
	Comment: >>inl1,inl2,inlstep,crl1,crl2,crlstep[,startz,stepz,nrz]
	Comment: Note: If specified, z range should be in seconds, meters or feet (whichever is appropriate).

cbvs_swap_inlcrl
	Arg: M`FileRead`Input seismic cube
	Arg: M`FileWrite`Output seismic cube
	Comment: Allows using cross-line sorted Import files.
	Comment: OpendTect needs Inline-sorted seismic data. If you have access to crossline-sorted data only, you need to use a trick.
	Comment: Load the cube from SEG-Y or 'simple file' with the cross-line as in-line number, and vice versa. You can only do that if you set the inline- and xline-ranges so that this 'mirrored' setup would be inside the survey rectangle. The Coordinate settings on the other hand need no change - these should be OK for the final situation all the time.
	Comment: After the import, you can set the inline- and xline-ranges to what they should be.
	Comment:When all that is done, use this cbvs_swap_inlcrl program to switch the inline and crossline number.
	Comment: Lastly, remove the 'swapped' imported cubes (you won't need those anymore) and import the new cubes via 'Import-Seismics-CBVS'.

process_attrib
	Arg: M`FileRead`Parameter file
	Comment: Use the OpendTect Attribute Engine.
	Comment: Is used by OpendTect for batch output, so it is unlikely that you will need to use the program from this place.

mk_2d_vol
	Arg: M`FileRead`Parameter file
	Comment: This program duplicates a single in-line into a cube.
	Comment: That cube can then be used to calculate e.g. a steering cube.
	ExampleInput: mk_2d_vol_example.par
!
rect_seis
	Arg: M`FileRead`Parameter file
	Comment: Fills gaps in an irregular cube with null traces.
	Comment: Unlike OpendTect, some ancient packages require fully filled cubes.
	ExampleInput: rect_seis_example.par

lmhostid
	Comment: Display the FlexLM hostid of this machine
	Comment: May be required for commercial plugins.
