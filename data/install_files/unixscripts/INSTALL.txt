OpendTect V4.4: installation notes.


First of all, you can find a sysadm manual for OpendTect on the web site
(http://opendtect.org) and in the distribution at:
doc/SysAdm/base/index.html

Below you'll find the 'bare' installation instructions for Linux, MS Windows
and Mac.

All installations:

As of 3.x version OpendTect will attempt to use 'shading' - this means that some
calculations are done on the graphics card. Unfortunately, not all cards
behave properly. Very old cards will be no problem because they report that
shading is not supported. Very new cards usually support it correctly (e.g. the
nVidia 6000 series). Some cards of about 1-2 years old do give problems. These
report that they support shading, but they support only part or so badly that
the system almost stops.

There are two settings for the user to cope with this:
* Do you want shading if the card reports that it is capable of it?
* If so, do you also want it for volume rendering?
Some cards (Like some ATI cards) support shading well but things go bad for
volume rendering.

The default is:
* Yes, use it if the card says it supports shading
* No, do not use it for volume rendering even if the card says it supports shading

Thus:
* If users get colorless inlines, time slices etc, they need to try disabling
shading usage
* If users want to try improved volume rendering, they can try enabling that.

The access to these options is in the menu 'Utilities-Settings-Look&Feel'.

Linux Installation instructions:


>> OpendTect need not be installed by 'root' (exception see note on SELinux). In
fact we recommend to use an 'application manager' account. In any case, use the
same user account for all application management actions. <<


Upgrades:
If you have a previous version of OpendTect installed, there are two
possibilities:
1) The version has the same release number (i.e. 4.x.y, eg 4.2.0).
   Download the packages you need to upgrade, and use the inst_pkgs.od
   script (use 'chmod +x inst_pkgs.od' if necessary) to install the packages.
2) The release number is different.
   Use the procedure for a new installation; you will get the chance to
   copy settings from the old installation. License files must
   always be installed afterwards; copying and re-starting is too tricky
   to do automatically.

New installations:
Download the packages you need, and the 'install.od' script (note that
depending on your browser you may need to right-click and choose 'save-as'),
and put all in the same directory. Run the install.od script
(use 'chmod +x install.od' or enter 'csh install.od').
When you download and save the script on Windows, but want to execute the
script on a UNIX machine, make sure the file is a real UNIX text file. If
necessary, run:
dos2unix install.od; chmod +x install.od
If the text is DOS text, errors like "'': command not found" will be the result.

After this, there should be an opendtect-4.x.y directory at the location you
selected. That directory contains OpendTect; scripts are present in that
directory to start OpendTect, batch programs, create data directories and more.

If all fails, unzip and untar the packages yourself and install the software
like:
cd opendtect-4.x.y
./install

Then:

1) If you haven't got a $DTECT_DATA directory yet, make sure of that now,
   use the 'mk_datadir' script to create such a directory. The resulting
   directory needs to have the right permissions for all users.

2) If one or more parts need FlexNET licensing, you may want to use the
   install.*.license scripts to import these files. If any of those is a
   floating license, you'll also need to bring up the license manager
   daemon. If you do not have your own procedures to start the daemons,
   you may want to use the start.*.lmgrd.cripts to do that.
   If you do have your own FlexNET management procedures (e.g. FlexAdmin), you
   have to make sure that a file 'license.*.dat' is present in the application
   directory containing the necessary license.

3) Now, the start_dtect script should bring up OpendTect.

Note: Red Hat 3: This distro is no longer supported as from version
4.0. On ftp.opendtect.org/pub/RH3_64 there is still a version for 3.2.

Note {Linux/SELinux]: Some distros have SELinux enabled by default. Disable or
administer the OpendTect executables and shared libs, like in:
chcon -t texrel_shlib_t `find . -name \*.so -print`

Note [ArkCls workstation link]: To be able to use the data link, you should
start OpendTect in a window prepared for running SeisWorks or GeoFrame. And,
of course, you'll need a valid license for the arkcls part itself.
The system administrator's manual contains information on these issues.

Development: for developing OpendTect plugins, you'll need to make sure the
following tools are installed:
* CMake (from cmake.org)
* [Linux/Mac]: GNU gcc 4.1.x or higher, including g++
* [M$ Windows]: Visual studio 2010 or higher.

MS Windows Installation instructions:

>> OpendTect is well prepared for separation of installation/Administrator and
usage accounts. We recommend to install as Administrator and use under a
non-privileged account. <<


OpendTect has an installer that will update your installation if necessary.
Virtually all settings will be in user areas, so no precious data should be
lost in this way.

Download the self-extracting executable and follow the instructions.
License management issues for commercial plugins may require extra actions.

Non English characters or accented characters are usually not recognized by
OpendTect. Make sure the OpendTect survey directory does not contain any
special characters, use simple English names like "C:\Surveys" or "C:\ODData"
instead. The Windows user/login name should also not contain these special
characters if they already contain special characters, use the evironment
variable DTECT_WINHOME and set a simple English name as value, like C:\ODHome.

Development: If you want to develop OpendTect plugins, you have to use Visual
Studio.

Mac OS/X Installation instructions:

Note: It seems that StuffIt may be unable to correctly unpack the
mac packages. The advice is to use Safari.

On Mac OS/X, you get a tar-gzipped Application Bundle. this .tar.gz contains an
OS/X bundle "opendtect.app", which contains 2 directories under the surface.
A directory "opendtect-4.x.y" containing the exact same contents as on any UNIX
OS and a directory "Contents" containing symbolic links at the places Mac OS/X
expects them into the UNIX tree. Therefore, most of UNIX instructions are also
applicable to Mac OS/X.

The application bundle contains not only the basic executables but
also the documentation and a demo survey. However, in order to install plugins, 
perform multi-machine batch processing or setup Workstation Access, you will
still have to go down to the UNIX style configuration of manually editing
some text files or run some scripts from a terminal window.

In that case, everything should otherwise be the same as with any other UNIX OS,
with that difference that the environment variable "DTECT_APPL" is basically 
equal to "<your path>/opendtect.app/opendtect-3.x" and that "DTECT_DATA" 
does not have to be set; it is normally set from the application and will
then be stored in your ~/.od/settings file.

Support for any OS/X version lower then 10.5 is not available.

The Madagascar plugin will NOT install Madagascar. Madagascar must be
installed separately. Please go to http://rsf.sourceforge.net . After
installation, check that the text-only documentation is installed.
If not, you need to issue the command:
$RSFROOT/bin/sfdoc -t $RSFROOT/doc/txt
